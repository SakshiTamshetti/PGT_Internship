## 📁 Repository structure


- `Phase1/`  
This folder has the basic work done in the first part of the internship.
## Day-wise Work (Phase 1)

- **Day 1:** Learned the basics of AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and different types of ML.   
- **Day 2–3:** Practiced Python fundamentals (variables, conditions, loops) and worked with functions, lists, dictionaries, and tuples in Jupyter Notebook.  
- **Day 4:** Used NumPy and Pandas to load and explore the Iris dataset (`Iris.xls`).  
- **Day 5:** Created visualizations on the stroke dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
