## 📁 Repository structure


### `Phase1/`  
This folder has the basic work done in the first part of the internship.

- **Day 1:** Learned the basics of AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and different types of ML.   
- **Day 2–3:** Practiced Python fundamentals (variables, conditions, loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, tuples) and started working with the Iris dataset. 
- **Day 4:** Used NumPy and Pandas to load, explore, and analyze the Iris dataset (`Iris.xls`) in more detail.
- **Day 5:** Studied the full ML lifecycle (problem definition, data collection, preprocessing, model selection, training & evaluation, and conceptual deployment), discussed common beginner mistakes in ML, and explored ethics and responsible AI practices.
